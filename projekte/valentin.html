        <p>  For this project we had to program our own website using HTML and CSS, but without using JavaScript. The idea was to create a website about ourselves as programmers on the behalf of a client. So the goal of my project was to create a website that shows my personality and tells you a little bit about me. We had to understand the code, write it ourselves, and be able to explain it, it should also have a proper structure and be clearly arranged. After receiving the brief for the project, I set myself the goal of programming an informative website, with an exciting structure, but keeping the design very simple. I programmed the code how I had learnt it in class. When it was necessary I researched different coding to broaden my horizon. At the beginning of the project I thought about how to express my personality and what people should know about me. I started by writing down a very rough draft for my website structure and did some sketches. For this I looked for inspiration from other websites and via muzli awards. After finding some websites to draw inspiration from I then improved my rough sketches and drew them on a sheet of paper, so that I was always able to make changes and improvements. Then I thought about what I wanted to write on my website, and which pictures I wanted to use. I spent a lot of time writing the texts and needed less time to choose the pictures. After this came the fine- tuning, coding, and perfecting the harmony of the colours.
